Fall Gambit uses RuboCop to keep the code nice and tidy.
To see it in action just run `rubocop` from the command line and see if you
committed some offense.
You can configure the `.rubocop.yml` file as you prefer.
To know more go to the [RuboCop GitHub page](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
and take a look at [The Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
